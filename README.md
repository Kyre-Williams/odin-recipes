# odin-recipes

In this project, I will be creating a website featuring an index file that has a list of various hyperlink recipes that connect to different pages with descriptions of said recipes. This will involve utilizing the list tag and anchor tag to reference, and I'll likely use relative paths for the reference information.

Once the project is complete, I would've proved my abilities in utilizing semantic HTML to create a basic website featuring links and brief descriptions of recipes, likely with a couple added images of the recipes ideal final look.
